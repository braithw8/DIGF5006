##### Performer Audience Contract
A most interesting tangent emerged during our first 'sounding' session as part of Adam Tindale's new course New Interfaces for Musical Expression. If that's familiar tituallary, it's an homage to the course's inpsiration, NIME â€“ The International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression. It's the first iteration of the course, but Adam's connection to the conference and his depth experience forecasts an exciting, engaging, and exprerimental six weeks.
Back to the tangent, in our first experimental listening and performance 'sounding' session, we embarked on a lively debate on the definition of a performance in a musical context. More specifically, we explored the figurative contract a performer has with their audience. Are their requirements of a peformer to qualify as such? If so, what are they?
